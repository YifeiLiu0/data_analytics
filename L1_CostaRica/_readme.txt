This is the README file for the cr.csv dataset. The cr.csv file contains data on the productivity of smallholding farms in Costa Rica. It is a small excerpt of the data generated by a large multi-country longitudinal study performed in the 1980s. The data has been cleaned and simplified for the purposes of this task. The .csv contains the following variables:

1. id: An individual identifier for each smallholding.
2. district_id: An individual identifier for each district (local government unit of Costa Rica).
3. canton_id: An individual identifier for each Canton (sub-national government unit of Costa Rica).
4. year: The years ranging from 1996 to 2005.
5. treat: A binary treatment indicator, taking a value of 1 if the farmer was instructed in optimal tree cultivation methods.
6. prod: An index of agricultural productivity. This measure is normalized to zero, so that positive values represent
         above-average productivity and vice-versa.
7. malehead: A binary indicator for whether the head of the household was male in a given year.
8. irrigation: The length of irrigation ditches available to each smallholding, measured in meters.
9. craft_income: Estimated income in USD, 2005 PPP, from non-agricultural activities.
10. crop_div: A crop diversity index calculated for each farm-year.
11. market_dist: distance from the nearest market, in KM
12. pop_density_1980: The population density of each district in 1980, persons/sqkm.
13. area: The area of the smallholding, measured in square meters.
14. rainfall__1: A normalized measure of precipitation at the sector level, estimate based on satellite data.
15. rainfall__2: A normalized measure of precipitation at the sector level, estimate based on researchers' own meteorological measurements.
16. means_index: An index of social deprivation based on ease of access to social services and amenities. Households with scores
                 above 65 were awarded preferential access to treatment.



The original study reported that instructing farmers how to use crop-rotation methods optimally increased productivity by 0.776 (s.e. 0.374) points.
